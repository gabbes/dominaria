## About
I Made this in anticipation of attending a Magic the Gathering prerelease 
tournament. With this app you will better memorize the new cards 
introduced with the set by individually focusing on specific cards at a time 
while simultaneously evaluation their comparative power rating.

The card ratings, created by [Draftsim](http://draftsim.com/), are based on 
limited formats, used here without factoring in many facets of deck 
construction. But they still give a pretty good suggestion about a cards 
overall strength.

## Development
Get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/gabbes/dominaria
cd dominaria
npm install
npm start
```
Build for production:

## Thanks
Thank to [Draftsim](http://draftsim.com/) for evaluating and rating the cards!
